Open firmware for Allwinner H3 SoC
----------------------------------

So far this code serves for experimentation with H3's secondary
OpenRISC core.

Currently it implements a stress test for CPUX_PLL on Orange Pi One:

- maximum CPU voltage is set (1.3V) via GPIO pin
- PLL frequency is randomly selected in the range from 60MHz to 1024MHz
- NKMP factors are calucalted (there are multiple methods available for
  testing - those used by mainline kernel, u-boot, reverse engineered
  table from the H3 firmware, etc.)
- PLL is applied (you can test a direct application without switching
  CPU to 24MHz oscillator, with switching, staged application of 
  dividers and multipliers, ...)
- To determine stability main ARM CPU runs a loop and sends a incrementing
  counter value via MSGBOX to OpenRISC CPU which is running the PLL tests.
  If we stop getting messages we assume PLL change failed.

So far the results are that:

1) M factor must always be 1, P factor must be 1 for frequencies above 
   288MHz (as noted in the H3 datasheet).

2) Switching ARM CPU temporarily to 24MHz oscillator does not improve
   stability at all.

3) Staged application of mukltipliers and dividers does not help stability
   either.

There is no nice interface to switching between various tests. You need
to edit the code.
